A macOS app that helps design accessible apps in three stages:

1. Design
The VoiceOver Designer app for macOS gives designers all possible instruments to lay out accessibility features on their mockups, teaches them what developers can and cannot do with accessibility, and creates specifications to hand over to developers. They can hear the result of their work on an iPhone via a little companion iPhone app called VoiceOver Preview.

Integrating it directly into Figma feels natural but can be done later.

2. Development

Developers get the instructions in the form of a VoiceOver Designer document from designers, read them and understand what accessibility features designers want them to implement.

3. Unit testing (in future releases)

The app generates test cases for automatic accessibility testing. In general, we can start from AccessibilitySnapshot, but use it differently: instead of performing image comparisons, we can create and compare textual representations of accessible elements. I'll elaborate on this idea on a different topic, as it's not the goal of the first release.
