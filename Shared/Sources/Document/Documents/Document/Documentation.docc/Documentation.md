# ``Document``

File structure that converts to in-memory ``Artboard``. Main goal â€“ persist user data and keep it safe. In feature we can integrate Figma's file structure

## Overview

Document package manages persistence by subclassing NSDocument in VODesignDocument

## Document versioning

We have 3 version formats
* beta-release of first users
* frame version of first release with single-page support
* artboard that supports multiple frames and connections between them

Migration consists from two steps:

- **Read old structure in memory**: the format in folder isn't changed during reading, but domain logic is independent according to file's structure. ``VODesignDocument/read(from:ofType:)``
- **Update document's structure during writing**: migration happens during writing process. During migration you had to update all relatives paths, images for e.g. ``VODesignDocument/fileWrapper(ofType:)``

Document structure depends on `FileWrapper` abstraction and not contains absolute paths. 

> Important: To properly keep cache unchanged you should use ``VODesignDocument/documentWrapper`` gathered from reading. 

> Tip: Keep snapshot of every version and write unit-tests for all possible actions and bugs during migration.
